            <h3>Opening sidework</h3>
            <p>
                Opening sidework is one of the important one (if not MOST).
                Because if the sidework isn't done the restaurant would not be
                able to operate properly. Usually goot teamwork leads to
                everything done in 30-40 minutes and it's all easy.
                <ol>
                    <li>Start brewing coffee. </li>
                    <p className="description">
                        It takes around 5 minutes for coffee. And everyone needs
                        coffee to start the shift (especially if it's morning
                        shift). While it's brewing — go to next item.
                    </p>
                    <li>Bring the clean water glasses</li>
                    <p className="description">
                        Usually there is at least one rack of clean glasses from
                        last night
                    </p>
                    <li>Brew iced tea</li>
                    <p className="description">
                        It takes around 10 minutes for tea. While the tea is
                        brewing do next items
                    </p>
                    <li>Set the bev station mats</li>
                    <li>Bring ice</li>
                    <li>Roll left over silverware</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <h3>For AM shift leaving</h3>
            <p>
                You finished with your morning shift and ready to go. YAY! But
                first… make sure you help your fellow coworkers for PM shift.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Tide up bev station (clean, throw away employee drinks etc)
                </li>
                <li>Bring glasses</li>
                <li>Bring ice</li>
                <li>Roll the silverware - IMPORTANT!</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Durring the shift</h3>
            <p>
                AM or PM shift - we still have to do sidework to help us work
                more efficiently.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    If you're not busy and the ice is half or lower — bring some
                    ice
                </li>
                <li>If you see clean glasses — bring them and put them up</li>
                <li>
                    If you see empty trays on the floor — put them up (coctail
                    or food trays)
                </li>
                <li>Dirty dishes go to the dishpit</li>
                <li>Bar glasses go to the bar</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Closing sidework</h3>

            <h4>Sidework for staff who's leaving early</h4>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Tidy up server/bev station</li>
                    <li>Roll silverware</li>
                    <li>Bring some ice</li>
                    <li>
                        Bus your tables, clean up your section/last tables area
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Check with a manager/closing server if anything else
                        needs to be done
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If your table closed out but didn't leave you either
                        have to wait for them or make sure that someone else is
                        going to be taking care of them if they need something
                        else.
                    </li>
                    <p className="description">
                        often happens that table either orders more or has
                        someone else joining who would like to order something.
                        Often table still has some food/drinks
                    </p>
                </ol>

            <h4>Closing staff</h4>
            <p>
                Since some of the sidework can't be done until the restaurant is
                closed the closing stuff besides checking previous sideworks has
                to finish up and close the restaurant.

                <li>
                    Dump the tea and coffee and "brew" the urn cleaner in the
                    containers (blue powder in a brown paper baggies)
